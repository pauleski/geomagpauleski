# geomag

Translate GPS location data to geo-magnetic data such as magnetic declination.

The difference between true north and magnetic north is called magnetic declination.
It is different everywhere on Earth and even changes over time.
Every five years or so, a couple of governing bodies release coefficients data for
calculating the magnetic declination at a given lat/lng and time.

[GeoMag] takes data from the World Magnetic Model Coefficients, [WmmCof],
to initialize. You can provide your own or use the bundled data, WMM-2025.
Use [calculate()] to process GPS coordinates into a
[GeoMagResult].

Accuracy is roughly within 0.2 degrees of test values.
